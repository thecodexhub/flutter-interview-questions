## Q1. What is Flutter?

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, and the web from a single codebase. Flutter was released in May 2017. Developers consider it as the fastest and most expressive way to create native apps. Flutter will have a significant impact on the development of high-quality, feature-packed mobile applications in the near future due to its simplicity, high performance as a result of its development, and rich user interface.

## Q2. What is Dart and Why does Flutter use it?

Dart is a programming language designed for client development, such as for the web and mobile apps. It is developed by Google and can also be used to build server and desktop applications. It is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax.

* Dart allows Flutter to avoid the need for a separate declarative layout language like JSX or XML, or separate visual interface builders, because Dart's declarative, programmatic layout is easy to read and visualize.
* Dart uses the Just In Time compilation. This drastically reduces the time of development and responds faster.

## Q3. What is `pubspec.yaml` file and what does it do?

Every Flutter project includes a `pubspec.yaml` file, which is generated while creating a new Flutter project. ItтАЩs located at the top of the project tree and contains metadata about the project that the Dart and Flutter tooling needs to know.

The pubspec file specifies dependencies that the project requires, such as particular packages (and their versions), fonts, or image files. It also specifies other requirements, such as dependencies on developer packages (like testing or mocking packages), or particular constraints on the version of the Flutter SDK.

## Q4. What is the difference between `main()` and `runApp()` functions in Flutter?

The `main()` function tells Dart where the program starts, and it must be in the file that is considered the "entry point" for the program. By convention, this will be in a file called `main.dart`. This main function can execute any code within it's code block.

The `runApp()` function should return widget that would be attached to the screen as a root of the widget tree that will be rendered.

## Q5. Differentiate between named parameters and positional parameters in Flutter.

A `Positional Parameter` is linked by its position. Positional parameters must be specified in the order in which they appear. `Named Parameters` are referenced by name, which means that they can be used during the function invocation in an order different from the function declaration.

To declare a positional optional parameter, we use square brackets `[ ]`, whereas to declare a named optional parameters we use curly braces `{ }`.

```dart
doSomething(String name, [String greeting = 'Hello']); // Positional Optional Parameter
doSomething({String? name, String greeting = 'Hello'}); // Named Optional Parameter
```

## Q6. What are widgets in Flutter?

Widgets are the central class hierarchy in the Flutter framework, that describes the configuration of an element to manage the underlying render tree. A widget is an immutable description of part of a user interface. Widgets themselves have no mutable state, i.e., all their fields must be final.

In Flutter, everything is a widget.

## Q7. What is `Hot Reload` and `Hot Restart` in Flutter?

Flutter's `Hot Reload` feature injects the updated source code files into the running **Dart Virtual Machine (VM)**, and rebuilds the widget tree preserving the app state to quickly view the effects of the changes.

Whereas `Hot Restart` loads the updated source code files into the VM and restarts the Flutter app, losing all the previous app states.

## Q8. What do you mean by open-source software? Is Flutter open-source?

Open-source software is software with with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. Open-source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, relying on peer review and community production. Open source software is often cheaper, more flexible, and has more longevity than its proprietary peers because it is developed by communities rather than a single author or company.

Yes, Flutter is an open-source software development kit.

## Q9. Differentiate between `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget` in Flutter.

`StatelessWidget`s are those that do not change, or are immutable. Its appearance and properties remain constant throughout the widget's lifetime. **Icon**, **IconButton**, **Text** are examples of stateless widgets.

`StatefulWidget`s are those that change their properties while running. They are dynamic, which means they can be rebuilt multiple times during their lifetime. It can alter its appearance in response to events caused by the user interactions or when data is received. **Checkbox**, **Radio**, **Slider**, **InkWell**, **Form**, and **TextField** are examples of stateful widgets.

## Q10. What is `BuildContext` in Flutter? And why is it needed?

`BuildContext` is a locator that tracks and locates each widget in a widget tree. `BuildContext` objects are passed to **WidgetBuilder** functions, and are available from the `State.context` member. Some static functions (e.g. **showDialog**, **Theme.of**, and so forth) also take build contexts so that they can act on behalf of the calling widget, or obtain data specifically for the given context.

There are many reasons why `BuildContext` is important. From locating widgets in the tree to interacting with **RenderObjects**, the context makes all of these interactions possible. It serves as the **bridge** between the widgets and rendering layer and is especially powerful for combining functionality or using information from one tree in another.

## Q11. What are packages and plugins in Flutter?

A package only contains Dart code. Some of the packages may use Flutter specific functionality and thus have a dependency on the Flutter framework.

A plugin contains Dart combined with one or more platform-specific native (Java/Swift/JavaScript) code. The API of the plugin is written in Dart and the implementations are written in native languages. Flutter uses platform channels to communicate with native codes.

# Q13. What are different build modes in Flutter?

The Flutter tooling supports three different build modes while compiling the app. We need to choose the build mode depending upon where we are in the development cycle.

- `debug`: For development purpose, the **hot reload** feature is enabled only in the debug mode.
- `profile`: For analyzing the app performance. We use DevTools suite to profile app's performance.
- `release`: For releasing the app when everything is ready.

## Q14. What is the difference between `WidgetsApp` and `MaterialApp` in Flutter?

`WidgetsApp` is a convenient widget that wraps a number of widgets that are commonly required for an application. It also provides basic navigation.

`MaterialApp` builds an application that uses the mterial design. It is built upon the `WidgetsApp` and contains some material-design specific functionality, such as **AnimatedTheme**. We certainly don't require `MaterialApp` every time when building a Flutter project. `CupertinoApp` gives iOS like look and feel, or we can even define our custom sets of widgets.
