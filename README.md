## Q1. What is Flutter?

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, and the web from a single codebase. Flutter was released in May 2017. Developers consider it as the fastest and most expressive way to create native apps. Flutter will have a significant impact on the development of high-quality, feature-packed mobile applications in the near future due to its simplicity, high performance as a result of its development, and rich user interface.

## Q2. What is Dart and Why does Flutter use it?

Dart is a programming language designed for client development, such as for the web and mobile apps. It is developed by Google and can also be used to build server and desktop applications. It is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax.

* Dart allows Flutter to avoid the need for a separate declarative layout language like JSX or XML, or separate visual interface builders, because Dart's declarative, programmatic layout is easy to read and visualize.
* Dart uses the Just In Time compilation. This drastically reduces the time of development and responds faster.

## Q3. What is `pubspec.yaml` file and what does it do?

Every Flutter project includes a `pubspec.yaml` file, which is generated while creating a new Flutter project. ItтАЩs located at the top of the project tree and contains metadata about the project that the Dart and Flutter tooling needs to know.

The pubspec file specifies dependencies that the project requires, such as particular packages (and their versions), fonts, or image files. It also specifies other requirements, such as dependencies on developer packages (like testing or mocking packages), or particular constraints on the version of the Flutter SDK.

## Q4. What is the difference between `main()` and `runApp()` functions in Flutter?

The `main()` function tells Dart where the program starts, and it must be in the file that is considered the "entry point" for the program. By convention, this will be in a file called `main.dart`. This main function can execute any code within it's code block.

The `runApp()` function should return widget that would be attached to the screen as a root of the widget tree that will be rendered.

</div>

## Q5. Differentiate between named parameters and positional parameters in Flutter.

A `Positional Parameter` is linked by its position. Positional parameters must be specified in the order in which they appear. `Named Parameters` are referenced by name, which means that they can be used during the function invocation in an order different from the function declaration.

To declare a positional optional parameter, we use square brackets `[ ]`, whereas to declare a named optional parameters we use curly braces `{ }`.

```dart
doSomething(String name, [String greeting = 'Hello']); // Positional Optional Parameter
doSomething({String? name, String greeting = 'Hello'}); // Named Optional Parameter
```

## Q6. What are widgets in Flutter?

Widgets are the central class hierarchy in the Flutter framework, that describes the configuration of an element to manage the underlying render tree. A widget is an immutable description of part of a user interface. Widgets themselves have no mutable state, i.e., all their fields must be final.

In Flutter, everything is a widget.

    <b><a href="#flutter-interview-questions">том back to top</a></b>
</div>

## Q7. What is `Hot Reload` and `Hot Restart` in Flutter?

Flutter's `Hot Reload` feature injects the updated source code files into the running **Dart Virtual Machine (VM)**, and rebuilds the widget tree preserving the app state to quickly view the effects of the changes.

Whereas `Hot Restart` loads the updated source code files into the VM and restarts the Flutter app, losing all the previous app states.

</div>

## Q8. What do you mean by open-source software? Is Flutter open-source?

Open-source software is software with with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. Open-source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, relying on peer review and community production. Open source software is often cheaper, more flexible, and has more longevity than its proprietary peers because it is developed by communities rather than a single author or company.

Yes, Flutter is an open-source software development kit.

## Q9. Differentiate between `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget` in Flutter.

`StatelessWidget`s are those that do not change, or are immutable. Its appearance and properties remain constant throughout the widget's lifetime. **Icon**, **IconButton**, **Text** are examples of stateless widgets.

`StatefulWidget`s are those that change their properties while running. They are dynamic, which means they can be rebuilt multiple times during their lifetime. It can alter its appearance in response to events caused by the user interactions or when data is received. **Checkbox**, **Radio**, **Slider**, **InkWell**, **Form**, and **TextField** are examples of stateful widgets.

</div>

## Q10. What is `BuildContext` in Flutter? And why is it needed?

`BuildContext` is a locator that tracks and locates each widget in a widget tree. `BuildContext` objects are passed to **WidgetBuilder** functions, and are available from the `State.context` member. Some static functions (e.g. **showDialog**, **Theme.of**, and so forth) also take build contexts so that they can act on behalf of the calling widget, or obtain data specifically for the given context.

There are many reasons why `BuildContext` is important. From locating widgets in the tree to interacting with **RenderObjects**, the context makes all of these interactions possible. It serves as the **bridge** between the widgets and rendering layer and is especially powerful for combining functionality or using information from one tree in another.

</div>

## Q11. What are packages and plugins in Flutter?

A package only contains Dart code. Some of the packages may use Flutter specific functionality and thus have a dependency on the Flutter framework.

A plugin contains Dart combined with one or more platform-specific native (Java/Swift/JavaScript) code. The API of the plugin is written in Dart and the implementations are written in native languages. Flutter uses platform channels to communicate with native codes.

# Q13. What are different build modes in Flutter?

The Flutter tooling supports three different build modes while compiling the app. We need to choose the build mode depending upon where we are in the development cycle.

- `debug`: For development purpose, the **hot reload** feature is enabled only in the debug mode.
- `profile`: For analyzing the app performance. We use DevTools suite to profile app's performance.
- `release`: For releasing the app when everything is ready.

## Q14. What is the difference between `WidgetsApp` and `MaterialApp` in Flutter?

`WidgetsApp` is a convenient widget that wraps a number of widgets that are commonly required for an application. It also provides basic navigation.

`MaterialApp` builds an application that uses the mterial design. It is built upon the `WidgetsApp` and contains some material-design specific functionality, such as **AnimatedTheme**. We certainly don't require `MaterialApp` every time when building a Flutter project. `CupertinoApp` gives iOS like look and feel, or we can even define our custom sets of widgets.

</div>

## Q15. Differentiate between final, const and static keyword.

The `final` keyword defines a variable that can be initialized once and cannot be changed after being assigned a value for the first time.

The `const` keyword defines a constant variable that should not be changed over time.

Now the only difference between the final and const variable is that **final is a runtime-constant**, which in turn means that its value can be assigned at runtime instead of the compile-time that we had for the const keyword.

The `static` keyword is used for a class-level variable and method that is the same for every instance of a class, this means if a data member is static, it can be accessed without creating an object. The static keyword allows data members to persist Values between different instances of a class.

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#flutter-interview-questions">том back to top</a></b>
</div>

## Q16. What are `StatefulWidget` Lifecycle methods. Explain briefly.

- **createState() method:** Whenever a StatefulWidget is created, the framework calls this method to create fresh State objects. This method must be overridden.

- **initState() method:** This method is the first method that is called while creating a StatefulWidget class. Here we allocate our resources, which means we can initialize our variable, data, and properties.

- **didChangeDependencies() method:** This method is called just after initState() method when a dependency of this State object changes. For example, if the previous build was referencing an InheritedWidget that changes, this method notifies the object to change.

    Generally, subclasses don't override didChangeDependencies() method because the framework calls build() methods after dependency change. But to do some expensive work, let's say some network calls, the method is preferred over doing everything on build() method itself.

- **build() method:** Every time the widget is rebuilt, the build() method is used. This can happen after calling initState(), didChangeDependencies(), or didUpdateWidget(), or after changing the state with a call to setState().

- **didUpdateWidget() method:** This method is called whenever the widget configuration changes. This method exists for triggering side-effects when one of the parameters in the StatefulWidget changes. A typical example is implicitly animated widgets.

- **setState() method:** This method notifies the framework that the internal state of this object has changed. The provided callback must be synchronous which might impact the user interface in the subtree. The framework schedules a build() for this current State object.

- **deactivate() method:** The framework calls this method when the State is removed from the tree, temporarily or permanently.

- **dispose() method:** This method is called when the State is removed from the tree, permanently. After the dispose() method is called, the State object is considered unmounted. Subclasses should override this method to release any resources retained by this object.

## Q17. What are keys and why do we need them?

Flutter uses keys to preserve the state and to uniquely identify specific widgets within a widget tree. It is used to preserve the state of the `StatefulWidget`s while they are being replaced with other widgets or just moved in the widget tree.

The most common usage of key is when we are dealing with collections of widgets that have the same type; so, without keys, the element tree would not know which state corresponds to which widget, as they would all have the same type.

## Q18. What is the difference between `Expanded` and `Flexible` widget?

The only difference between these two widgets is the `Flexible` widget takes only the space needed by the child, whereas the `Expanded` widget enforces its child to take all the available space.

The `Expanded` widget in flutter is shorthand of `Flexible` with the fit set to **FlexFit. tight**.

```dart
Column(children: [
  Row(
    children: [_ExpandedWidget(), _FlexibleWidget()],
  ),
  Row(
    children: [_ExpandedWidget(), _ExpandedWidget()],
  ),
  Row(
    children: [_FlexibleWidget(), _FlexibleWidget()],
  ),
]),
```

## Q19. What is Fat Arrow Notation in Dart?

A fat arrow (=>) is used to define a single expression in a function. This is a cleaner way to write functions with a single statement.

Syntax:

```
ReturnType FunctionName(Params) => Expression;
```

Example:

```dart
// Without fat arrow notation
String findSquare(int n) {
  return 'The square of $n is ${n * n}.';
}

// With fat arrow notation
String findSquare(int n) => 'The square of $n is ${n * n}.';
```

## Q20. What is the purpose of `SafeArea` widget in Flutter?

The `SafeArea` widget insets its child by sufficient padding to avoid intrusions by the operating system. For example, this will indent the child by enough to avoid the status bar at the top of the screen. It will also indent the child by the amount necessary to avoid the Notch, or similar creative physical features of the display.

## Q21. What are `Slivers`?

A sliver is a portion of a scrollable area that you can define to behave in a special way. You can use slivers to achieve custom scrolling effects, such as elastic scrolling.

Under the hood, slivers are used to implement all of the scrollable views you use, including ListView and GridView. Slivers can be compared to a lower-level interface that offers more precise control over the implementation of scrollable areas.

Sliver lets you render child widgets lazily or render only the visible segment of the screen. Additionally, Sliver provides a better experience when you need to scroll a list of items and a grid of items all together as a single unit or create a collapsible header. It makes the overall scrolling effect of large lists effective and efficient.

## Q22. What is the extension method in Dart?

Extension method allows us to add new functionality on top of existing libraries.For example, you can add extra functionality to the Dart core String library, that are only available in your app.

Syntax to create an extension method:

```
extension <extension name> on <type> {
  // (<member definition>)*
}
```

Example of an Dart extension method:

```dart
// an extension method
extension StringExtension on String {
  String capitilizeWord() {
    return this.split(' ').map((word) => word[0].toUpperCase() + word.substring(1)).join(' ');
  }
}

// example of using the above extension
String myString = 'welcome to the flutter world!!!';
print(myString.capitilizeWord()); // Welcome To The Flutter World!!!
```

Here is how we can unleash the power of extension methods in Flutter:

```dart
// an extension on widget
extension WidgetExtension on Widget {
  Widget addPadding([double padding = 8.0]) {
    return Padding(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(padding),
      child: this,
    );
  }
}

// example of using the above extension
Text('Text widget with the default padding of 8.0').addPadding();
Text('Text widget with padding of 16.0').addPadding(16.0);
```

## Q23. Explain the `mounted` property. How is it important and when to use it?

The mounted property defines whether the state object, associated with it, is currently in the widget tree.

After creating a State object and before calling initState, the framework **"mounts"** the State object by associating it with a BuildContext. The State object remains mounted until the framework calls dispose, after which time the framework will never ask the State object to build again.

It is an error to call setState unless mounted is true. This property is useful when a method on your state calls setState() but it isn't clear when or how often that method will be called. You can use `if (mounted) {...` to make sure the State exists before calling setState().

## Q24. What is sound null safety?

**Sound null safety** makes types in code non-nullable by default and enables special static checks and compiler optimizations to guarantee that null-dereference errors won't appear at runtime because they will be spotted at compile-time and fixed.

**Null safety** is a guarantee within an object-oriented programming language that no object references will have null or void values.

## Q25. Differentiate between `mainAxisAlignment` and `crossAxisAlignment`.

The `mainAxisAlignment` determines how the children should be placed along the main axis in a flex layout. Whereas, the `crossAxisAlignment` determines how the children will be placed along the cross axis in a flex layout.

For a `Row` widget: 
- **mainAxisAlignment** --> Horizontal axis
- **crossAxisAlignment** --> Vertical axis

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/row_diagram.png" alt="MainAxisAlignment vs CrossAxisAlignment - Row" />

For a `Column` widget: 
- **mainAxisAlignment** --> Vertical axis
- **crossAxisAlignment** --> Horizontal axis

## Q26. What are mixins? How to use them?

A mixin is a class whose methods and properties can be used by other classes тАУ without subclassing. It's a reusable chunk of code that can be plugged in to any class that needs this functionality.

Example of a mixin:

```dart
// To create a mixin, use `mixin` keyword instead of `class`.
mixin GreetingsMixin {
  String greeting = 'Hello people';

  void introduce() => print('$greeting, I am Sandip.');
}

// The following example shows two classes that use the above mixin.
class Something extends MyClass with GreetingsMixin {
  // ...
}

class SomethingElse extends MyAnotherClass with GreetingsMixin {
  SomethingElse() {
    greeting = 'Hi everyone';
  }
}

// Here is how to use them
SomethingElse obj = SomethingElse();
obj.introduce();  // Hi everyone, I am Sandip.
```

Sometimes you want to restrict from mixing in functionality to classes that have no deal with the mixin. To restrict a mixin, use the 'on' keyword to specify the required subclass.

```dart
class SocialMedia {
  // ...
}

// Create a mixin restricted on [SocialMedia] class
mixin SocialMediaGreetings on SocialMedia {
  String greeting = 'Hello people';

  void introduce() => print('$greeting, I am Sandip.');
}

// Only classes that extend or implement the [SocialMedia] class
// can use the mixin [SocialMediaGreetings]
class Twitter extends SocialMedia with SocialMediaGreetings {
  Twitter() {
    greeting = 'Hello Tweeple';
  }
}
```

## Q27. What is the difference between `Container` and `SizedBox` widget?

**SizedBox** is a widget for giving some constant height or width between two widgets. It does not contain any decorative properties just like color, shape, borderRadius etc.

On the other hand **Container** is a widget that any person can modify according to their needs.

When used for whitespace, there is a linter warning to prefer SizedBox instead of Container. Because a Container is a heavier widget than a SizedBox, and as bonus, SizedBox has a const constructor, so it won't even create a new instance during runtime.

## Q28. What do you mean by Null-aware operators?

Null aware operator allows us to make computations based on whether or not a value is null.

Example of null-aware operators are:

- **Optional Chaining Operator (?.):**

  We use ?. when we want to call a method/getter on an object if and only if that object is not null (otherwise, return null).

  ```dart
  String? name = user?.name;

  // This code is same as
  // String? name = (user == null) ? null : user.name;
  ```

- **Default Operator (??):**

  We use ?? when you want to evaluate and return an expression if another expression resolves to null. It is also called the **if-null operator** and **coalescing operator**. The null-aware operator is ??, which returns the expression on its left unless that expressionтАЩs value is null. In which case itтАЩs null it returns the expression on its right.

  ```dart
  String? hello;
  String? greeting = hello ?? 'Hey';

  // This code is same as
  // String? greeting = (hello == null) ? 'Hey' : hello;
  ```

- **Logical Nullish Assignment (??=):**

  We use ??= when we want to assign a value to an object if that object is null. Otherwise, it returns the object.

  ```dart
  int? x;
  x ??= 3;  // Assigns 3 to the variable `x`
  x ??= 5;  // As x is not null now, it's value is still 3
  ```

## Q29. What is `AppLifecycleState`?

The `AppLifecycleState` defines the state that an application can be.

- **detached (AppLifecycleState.detached):** This means the application is still hosted on flutter engine but is detached from any host views. It can either be in the progress of attaching a view when engine was first initializes, or after the view being destroyed due to a Navigator pop.

- **inactive (AppLifecycleState.inactive):** This means the application is in an inactive state and is not receiving user input. Simply we can say the app is in the foreground and not running in the background on your mobile phone.

- **paused (AppLifecycleState.paused):** This means the application is not currently visible to the user, not responding to user input, and running in the background.

- **resumed (AppLifecycleState.resumed):** This means the application is visible and responding to user input.

## Q30. What is the difference between `NetworkImage` and `Image.network` in flutter?

`NetworkImage` class creates an object that provides an image from the src URL passed to it. It is not a widget and does not output an image to the screen.

`Image.network` creates a widget that displays an image on the screen. It is just a named constructor on the **Image** class. It sets the image property using the **NetworkImage** . This image property is then used to display the image.
