## Q1. **What is Flutter?**

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, and the web from a single codebase. Flutter was released in May 2017. Developers consider it as the fastest and most expressive way to create native apps. Flutter will have a significant impact on the development of high-quality, feature-packed mobile applications in the near future due to its simplicity, high performance as a result of its development, and rich user interface.
